Git Version Control Basics

Git is a distributed version control system. Each developer has a complete copy of the repository history. Commits create snapshots of changes. Branches enable parallel development. Merging combines changes from different branches.

The staging area allows selective commit preparation. Push uploads commits to remote repositories. Pull downloads and integrates remote changes. Rebase rewrites commit history for cleaner timelines.
