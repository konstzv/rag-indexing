Web Development Essentials

HTML provides the structural foundation of web pages using semantic elements. Headings, paragraphs, links, and images organize content meaningfully. Proper semantic markup improves accessibility and search engine optimization.

CSS styles HTML elements, controlling layout, colors, typography, and responsive design. Flexbox and Grid enable modern layout techniques. Media queries adapt designs for different screen sizes, ensuring mobile-friendly experiences.

JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. DOM manipulation updates page content in response to user actions. Event listeners respond to clicks, key presses, and other interactions. Fetch API enables asynchronous data retrieval from servers.

Modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular streamline complex application development. Component-based architecture promotes reusability and maintainability. State management libraries handle data flow in large applications. Virtual DOM optimizes rendering performance.

Backend development handles server-side logic and data management. REST APIs define interfaces for client-server communication. Databases store and retrieve application data. Authentication and authorization protect resources and user information.
